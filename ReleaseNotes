=== RMW Release Notes ===

v0.8.0

  * The config option 'purge_after' has been deprecated and replaced
  with 'expire_age' ('purge_after' will still be accepted, but the user
  will be given a deprecation warning).

  * When '-u' is used, the mrl file will no longer be removed, but
  emptied instead. If a user gives the '-u' option when the mrl file is
  empty, they will get a friendlier message stating that there are no
  items in the list (instead of an error message about the file not
  being found).

  * fixed handling of dot dirs ('.' and '..'). Instead of giving an
  error message and quitting, rmw will print a message stating that
  they'll be skipped.

  * The environmental variable RMWTEST_HOME has been replaced with
  RMW_FAKE_HOME (Trying to use RMWTEST_HOME will give a deprecation
  warning and still work).

  * Expanded the man page and updated the README (improved documentation)

  * Replaced autotools build system with meson

  * rmw now uses the canfigger library for parsing the configuration file.

  - disabled a restore test that failed when 'make check' is run with
  superuser privileges
